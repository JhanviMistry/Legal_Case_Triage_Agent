# 🧠 Agentic Case Triage AI

An **agentic, explainable legal case triage system** designed for legal advice centres (e.g. Queen Mary Legal Advice Centre). The system automatically validates, classifies, routes, and explains legal enquiries while maintaining **auditability, transparency, and legal-team readiness**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **multi-agent architecture** that processes incoming legal enquiries and determines:

* Whether the case is **eligible** for triage
* Which **legal domain** it belongs to (e.g. Employment, Housing)
* Where it should be **routed**
* How confident the system is in its decision
* A **human-readable explanation** suitable for clients and legal staff

The system is built with:

* **FastAPI** (backend)
* **React + Vite** (frontend)
* Modular **Agent pattern** for transparency and extensibility

Each agent:

* Has a **single responsibility**
* Mutates a shared `state` object
* Appends explainable steps for audit purposes

## 🔍 Explainability & Audit Readiness

This system is **designed for legal compliance**:

* Domain and confidence are **explicitly exposed** (not hidden)
* Every decision step is logged in `state['steps']`
* Explanations are client-safe and legally neutral
* MemoryAgent supports future audit & improvement

✔ Suitable for legal clinics
✔ GDPR-conscious architecture
✔ Human-in-the-loop friendly

---

## 🧪 Feature Flags

Enable LLM-based reasoning (optional):

```bash
export USE_LLM_REASONER=true
```

(Default: rule-based reasoning)

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

* [ ] Frontend redesign (client-friendly UI)
* [ ] Role-based views (client vs legal team)
* [ ] Persistent storage (PostgreSQL)
* [ ] Full audit log export
* [ ] Multilingual support

---

## 👩‍⚖️ Intended Use Disclaimer

This system **does not provide legal advice**. It performs triage only and is designed to assist legal professionals by:

* Filtering ineligible cases
* Reducing admin workload
* Improving response consistency
